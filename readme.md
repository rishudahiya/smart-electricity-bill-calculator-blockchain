# Smart Electricity Bill Calculator on Blockchain

## Introduction

This project aims to create a decentralized and transparent system for calculating and paying electricity bills using blockchain technology. The system will allow customers to view and pay their bills in real-time, and will also provide a tamper-proof record of all transactions.

## Benefits

- **Decentralized:** The system will not be controlled by a single entity, ensuring that there is no single point of failure and that the system remains secure.

- **Transparent:** The blockchain technology used in the system will ensure that all transactions are recorded and can be viewed by anyone on the network. This provides a level of transparency that is not possible with traditional systems.

- **Real-time billing:** Customers will be able to view and pay their bills in real-time, providing them with a more accurate and up-to-date view of their usage and costs.

- **Tamper-proof:** The blockchain technology used in the system ensures that all transactions are recorded in a tamper-proof manner, providing a secure and trustworthy system.

## Implementation

- **Smart meters:** The system will use smart meters to accurately measure and record electricity usage in real-time.

- **Blockchain network:** The system will be built on top of a blockchain network, such as Ethereum, to ensure that all transactions are recorded in a transparent and tamper-proof manner.

- **Smart contract:** A smart contract will be used to automatically calculate and bill customers based on their usage.

- **Payment gateway:** A payment gateway will be integrated into the system to allow customers to easily pay their bills using cryptocurrency or other digital assets.
